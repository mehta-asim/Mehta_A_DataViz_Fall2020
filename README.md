These graphs are further added on a website specifically designed to share required insights.

## Prerequisites

Clone the project, <code>cd</code> to your directory/download, and run the index.html file to look at the website.<br>
If you want to generate your own graphs then you can<br>
1.Open any of the files from data folder inside a code editor.<br>
2.Make any necessary changes in the code if there are any.<br>
